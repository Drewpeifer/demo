This is an HTML/CSS/jQuery proof-of-concept for creating
a seamless starfield animation. I've dabbled with some fun stuff
like a warp effect and the color/size/brightness of the stars,
but mostly it was just to see how much JS it would take to have
a clean animation with no leaks that worked on most browsers.
