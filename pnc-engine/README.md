PNCMaker
=========
This is a work-in-progress (on hiatus) prototype for a browser-based point-and-click (PNC) game engine.

Demo: [drewpeifer.com/demo/pnc-engine](http://www.drewpeifer.com/demo/pnc-engine "PNC-Engine demo")

*When completed*, using this library of files along with a set of basic instructions,
a person with no HTML/CSS/jQuery experience should be able to
create a cross-browser point-and-click adventure game, similar to
old titles like _Beneath a Steel Sky_, _Full Throttle_, or _Space Quest_.

While the engine is being designed, the content of index.html is being used as a
sandbox for testing behavior, animations, etc. Eventually, the content of that page will
be dynamically generated by Javascript based upon the data added to plain-text files, supplied
by the game's developer.

What is it?
==========
PNCMaker is a game engine, not an IDE, which drives the game's mechanics
(the abilities, behaviors, and limitations of your game). Everything within the game,
its settings, characters, sights and sounds are all supplied by the developer, either in
the format of images, audio, or plain text files. The following features will be supported
out-of-box, just to name a few:

* animated characters, objects, and environments
* inventory / item functionality
* linked environments (e.g. levels composed of individual/connected areas)
* on-screen text prompt
* text-based conversations w/ audio
* music / sound effects

This engine should provide all that functionality and more, allowing the developer to
focus on creating the content of his/her game. The intent is to allow the developer as much
flexibility as possible without restricting them to certain types of games/scenarios.
Nevertheless, the end-result should be reminiscent of golden age PNC adventures, in which
the player navigates around an environment, interacting with items, characters, and the
environment itself.

How does it work?
=================
The content of each game, e.g. everything on the screen, is supplied by the developer.
A game is composed of a level, or several, and each level is composed of areas.
Each area may contain characters, items, or custom objects to interact with. Areas can be linked in complex ways, including event-based "locking" (for example, requiring the player to talk to someone before opening a door).

Each area has its content outlined in the corresponding area template file, which will
be a text file written in a custom syntax close to Markdown. Using these area templates,
along with similarly constructed level template, the engine will generate HTML on the page
to represent whatever area the player is currently viewing. The goal is for these area
templates to be as close to a plain-English description of the scene as possible.

What's underneath the hood?
===========================
I'm currently using [transit.js](http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/),
[Spritely](http://www.spritely.net/), and jQuery/jQuery-ui. This may change over time.
[LESS](http://lesscss.org/) is a likely candidate for integration but isn't necessary at
this stage.
