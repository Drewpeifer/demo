				Real men don't have time to "grocery shop",
				we're too busy riding horses and forging steel.
				Sometimes there's no crisper full of green
				things or cedar shelf lined with baby-sized jars of
				fancy-pants spices. Usually you're stuck with
				condiments and various unperishables, like dry pasta,
				tiny onions in a jar, SPAM if you're lucky. We make
				the best of what we've got, and dammit, it's
				delicious.
