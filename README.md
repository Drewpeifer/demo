the demo repo
==============

I've stored some of my personal demos in this repository, and I've archived their previous
homes on github.

Each subdirectory in this repo has its own readme, which should tell you a little more
about the project. Most have been created for recreation or as a proof of concept, but
all will remain publicly available and free to use indefinitely.

If you choose to fork this repo and like what you see, or make some improvements you
think I'd like to see, feel free to get in touch.
