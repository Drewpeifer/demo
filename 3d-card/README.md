3D Business Card demo
=====================

Demo: [drewpeifer.com/demo/3d-card](http://www.drewpeifer.com/demo/3d-card "3D Business Card")

A responsive mobile-friendly proof-of-concept for a simple
rotating, content-enabled business card made with HTML/CSS/jQuery.

Some people want one-page websites with contact information, a URL or two,
and maybe some social network icons. What they end up requesting is basically
a virtual business card, sometimes verbatim. So, this was a modest design for
a floating, rotating business card with the ability to embed links and expanded
text within a pop-up.
