This is a JSON API demo that pulls from [the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod).

Live demo available [here](http://www.drewpeifer.com/demo/apod-engine/index.html).

This is a single page application built with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/),
a little [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/) for the inputs, and the
[starfield background](http://www.drewpeifer.com/demo/space/index.html) uses
[transit.js](http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/) for cross-browser friendliness.
