SpaceTrade
=========
A space-themed resource trading game.

This is currently a work-in-progress (including the name),
and should not be taken as an example
of well-organized code. New features are being added all the time, usually
faster than the bugs are being fixed, but I try to keep the dev and master branches
in sync and as stable as possible for all devices.

Certain features and functionality won't be available for a while, so if
you're reading this and viewing the demo, be gentle.
It's coming along slowly but surely.
